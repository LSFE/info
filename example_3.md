### Standardized storage of satellite data

<p align="justify">
One of the main issues in sharing data and tools between researchers has to do with the way we store and use data. Often, each researcher has its data structure which makes it hard to apply re-apply a tool. As a consequence, adapting the work of someone else might be a bigger effort than writting our own functions leading to an unnecessary replication of work.
To avoid this, we developed a series of tools to create a standized structure for satellite data and its corresponding metadata. Ideally, this function can be used in combination with <i>lsfeData</i> (see example <a href="https://github.com/LSFE/info/blob/master/example_3.md">here</a>)


See the examples below for the covered sensors.
